## CDBMS (C Database Management System)

CDBMS is a simple console-based Database Management System written in the C programming language. This project allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a set of records. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the implementation of a basic database system in C.

### Features:

- **Add Record:** Add new records to the database with fields such as ID, name, and age.
- **View Records:** Display all records currently in the database.
- **Search Records:** Search for records based on specific criteria (e.g., search for a record by ID).
- **Update Record:** Modify existing records by updating specific fields.
- **Delete Record:** Remove records from the database.
- **Save/Load Records:** Persist records to a file and load them from a file.

### How to Use:

1. Compile the code using a C compiler.
2. Run the executable to start the console-based DBMS.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the database.
4. Optionally, save and load records to/from a file.
